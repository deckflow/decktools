# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0 migration candidate] - 2026-09-05

- Rename the tool distribution to `decktools`, the TypeScript SDK to `@deckflow/decktools-sdk`, the Go module to `github.com/deckflow/decktools/sdks/go`, and the Python distribution/import to `decktools-sdk` / `decktools`.
- Use only the `decktools` binary; no alias or forwarding release. The former DeckParse product is becoming the independent DeckOps.
- Shared credentials and UUID stay under `DECKFLOW_CONFIG_DIR` (default `~/.deckflow`). Product overrides use `DECKTOOLS_*`, never the old `DECKOPS_*` namespace. Node CLI product preferences live in `~/.deckflow/decktools/config.json` (`DECKTOOLS_CONFIG_DIR`).
- Keep environment overrides out of saved credentials and preserve other products' shared fields.
- This is a source candidate, not a published release; see `MIGRATION_STATUS.md` for cutover gates.

## [Previous unreleased work — legacy DeckOps]

The following entries describe the old product and its historical migration instructions, not current configuration precedence.

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Shared credentials now live at `~/.deckflow/credentials` (same file/format as deckhtml: `apiKey` / `token` / `spaceId` / `apiBase` / `webhook` / `retentionHours`). Override with `DECKFLOW_CONFIG_DIR` (also accepts `DECKHTML_CONFIG_DIR` / `DECKOPS_CONFIG_DIR`). SDK `auth-uuid` moved to `~/.deckflow/auth-uuid`. Migrate with:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p ~/.deckflow
  # if you only have the old deckops file:
  mv ~/.deckops/config.json ~/.deckflow/credentials
  # or merge token/spaceId/apiBase into an existing ~/.deckflow/credentials from deckhtml
  ```

### Fixed

- **Task polling / detail 404**: `getTask`, SSE subscribe, and `deleteTask` now send `spaceId` as a query parameter when the client is configured with a space (same as `task list`), fixing backends that require space scope for `/tools/tasks/:id`.

### Changed

- **API errors**: When the response includes `X-RequestId` (or common variants), it is appended to the error text and exposed as `requestId` in `--json` error output for easier support/debugging. Also reads correlation ids from JSON error bodies (e.g. `requestId`) and from `AxiosHeaders.toJSON()` when plain header iteration misses values. `ctx.error` now accepts the caught error object so `APIError` metadata is preserved in `--json` mode.
- **API errors**: Response body is always printed for `APIError`—terminal mode shows a **Response body:** block (pretty JSON / text, truncated at 32k chars); `--json` adds `body` (parsed) and `bodyText` (formatted string).

### Added

- **New `create` command** for document generation (CLI verb; API task type remains `generation`)
  - Supports text-only or file-assisted generation
  - Requires at least one of `inputText` or input files
  - Supports up to 2 reference files
  - Supports extensions: `.html`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.pptx`, `.txt`, `.md`, `.mm`, `.xmind`, `.ipynb`
- **New `translate` command** for document translation
  - Supports extensions: `.docx`, `.pptx`, `.pdf`, `.xlsx`, `.key`
  - `model` is required: `Standard` or `Pro`
  - `engine` parameter has been removed from the CLI

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added

- **New `login` command** for interactive authentication
  - Opens browser automatically for login
  - Uses local callback server to receive token
  - Automatically saves token to configuration
  - Similar to npm/GitHub CLI login experience
  - Example: `deckflow login`

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- **New `ocr` command** for Optical Character Recognition
  - Dedicated command for extracting text from images
  - Supports 12 languages via `--language` parameter
  - Example: `deckflow ocr image.jpg --language en`

### Removed

- **`file` command removed**
  - File upload is now an internal operation
  - Users interact with higher-level commands (compress, ocr, convert, etc.)
  - File upload happens automatically when needed

### Changed

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Configuration directory moved from `~/.tools-ui/` to `~/.deckops/`
  - Config file now located at `~/.deckops/config.json`
  - This provides a more intuitive and branded directory name
  - Users need to reconfigure or manually move their existing config file
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: `render` command renamed to `convert`
  - `--format` parameter renamed to `--to`
  - Example: `deckflow convert slides.pptx --to pdf` (previously `deckflow render slides.pptx --format pdf`)
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: OCR moved from `extract` to dedicated `ocr` command
  - Old: `deckflow extract image.jpg --type ocr --language en`
  - New: `deckflow ocr image.jpg --language en`
  - `extract` command now only supports `fonts` and `text-shapes` types
- **spaceId is now optional**
  - Only authentication token is required for configuration

### Migration Guide

If you have an existing configuration at `~/.tools-ui/config.json`, you can migrate it:

```bash
# Option 1: Move the entire directory
mv ~/.tools-ui ~/.deckops

# Option 2: Reconfigure with the CLI
deckflow config set-token YOUR_TOKEN
deckflow config set-space YOUR_SPACE_ID
```
